```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "crypto-exchange-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "crypto-exchange-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Usage

This MCP service provides the following tools:

1. `Query Exchange SDK supported methods` - Lists all available methods for the exchange SDK
2. `Query Exchange SDK method usage information` - Gets detailed documentation for a specific method
3. `Query Exchange SDK README` - Gets the README content of the exchange SDK project

## Architecture

The service is designed with extensibility in mind, making it easy to add support for new exchanges in the future. Each exchange is implemented as an adapter following a common interface, making it simple to add support for new exchanges.

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Build the project
pnpm run build

# Development mode (watch for changes)
pnpm run dev

# Test with MCP inspector
pnpm run inspect

# Generate offline data for exchanges
pnpm run generateOfflineData
```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to add support for a new exchange, please follow the adapter pattern established in the codebase.
