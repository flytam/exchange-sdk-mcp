1. `Query Exchange SDK supported methods` - Lists all available methods for the exchange SDK
2. `Query Exchange SDK method usage information` - Gets detailed documentation for a specific method
3. `Query Exchange SDK README` - Gets the README content of the exchange SDK project

## Architecture

The service is designed with extensibility in mind, making it easy to add support for new exchanges in the future. Each exchange is implemented as an adapter following a common interface, making it simple to add support for new exchanges.

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install
```

# Build the project
